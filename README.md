# Sales-Dashboard
Given sales data from 2019-2022, I created a dashboard showing KPI trend overview using sparklines which demonstrate the comparison of the past year (2021) and the current year (2022) with YOY change. KPI overview trend also indicates which month has the highest total sales, total profit, total quantity and which month has the lowest total sales, total profit, total quantity in the current year.   
Next, the dashboard shows the total sales and profits for the current year distributed across all the states in the U.S identified with colors to help us know which state has the highest current year's total sales and profits.
